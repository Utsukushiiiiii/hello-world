# hello-world
Hello,

This is my first repository on GitHub. Besides from this generic standard comment from a newcomer like me, I hope to be able to contribute and help other people/user here. Furthermore I hope to expand my knowledge by using this site etc.
So all in all I said some pretty obvious things but I wanted to say more than "This is my first repository on Github", oh well I tried and I don't know what else to say about this first repository of mine. If you got interested in me, like hobbys, programming experience, etc. Why not just asking me privately instead of me listing all things up here. I will try to improve with the next repositories I will make.
